# 💼 Fraudulent Claim Detection

## 📘 Project Overview
Global Insure, a leading insurance provider, processes thousands of claims annually—many of which are later identified as fraudulent, leading to significant financial losses. This project aims to develop a data-driven solution using machine learning to classify insurance claims as **fraudulent** or **legitimate** early in the approval process.

## 🎯 Business Objective
The goal is to build a model that can predict the likelihood of fraud in incoming insurance claims using historical claim details and customer profiles.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and understand the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
3. **Train-Validation Split (70-30)**: Create datasets for model development and evaluation.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - On training data
5. **Feature Engineering**: Construct and select the most relevant features.
6. **Model Building**: Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).
7. **Prediction & Evaluation**: Test the model and assess its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📍 Outcome
The developed model successfully achieved an **accuracy of 83%** using both **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** classifiers. In addition to accuracy, the models demonstrated **strong Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**, indicating a well-balanced performance across both fraud and non-fraud classes.

These results suggest that the model is not only effective in identifying fraudulent claims but also reliable in minimizing false positives, making it a valuable tool for enhancing Global Insure’s fraud detection capabilities and reducing financial losses.
